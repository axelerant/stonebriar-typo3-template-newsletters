There are three words that will cause most of you to begin to sweat, 
just by reading them, <b>Summer in Texas.</b>  Multiple 100 degree
days, yards that are brown and dry, and ever increasing electric bills are phrases 
that come to mind in our heat induced delirium during the long months of summer. 
<br><br>
When 18 individuals from Stonebriar left 
June 27 for a mission trip to Guatemala, which 
is <i>south</i> of us and therefore nearer to the equator, 
they expected it to be even hotter. However, 
working in the mountainous country of Guatemala, which is called &#147;The Land of Eternal Spring&#148; brought a respite from the Texas heat and also brought an even
sweeter satisfaction at the opportunities that the Lord placed before our team.
<br><br>
Team members of varying ages and skills were completely unified and able to participate 
in a variety of ministries where they reached out 
to the people of Guatemala. Our team consisted of three main ministry areas:
<br><br>
	<b>Medical Clinic </b>
	
<br> The Stonebriar Team had three nurses and multiple <IMG SRC="http://www.stonebriar.org/fileadmin/pageassets_3.0/HelpingOthers/Missions/Missions_Newsletter/mission_trip2.jpg"
ALT="Guatemala Trip Photo" hspace="10" vspace="10" 
align="left"></a>volunteers who 
partnered with a team of medical students from the U.S. and Guatemalan 
doctors and dentists to see more than 600 patients in three days. 
They served men, women and children of all ages who were seeking to 
have their needs met at the clinic. 
There were four main components to the clinic: 
dental, vision, medical, and the pharmacy. 
Our team helped meet their physical needs,
 and also prayed with most of the patients, including several that accepted Christ.
<br><br>
</a>	<b>Vacation Bible School </b><br>
<IMG SRC="http://www.stonebriar.org/fileadmin/pageassets_3.0/HelpingOthers/Missions/Missions_Newsletter/mission_trip3.jpg"
ALT="Guatemala Trip VBS Photo" hspace="10" vspace="10" 
align="right">
 Our Stonebriar team led a VBS that had more than 500 children a day, 
 with ten workers and three languages!!! 
 After the first day, the local school officials 
 cancelled the afternoon portion of school 
 so all the children could participate. 
 The stories, songs, and crafts were entertaining 
 and all told the message that God loves these children. 
 The rain and facilities were 
 difficulties that did not deter the 
 love or passion that our team showed these children.<br><br>
 
<b>Pastor&#146;s Seminar </b> 
Three Stonebriar pastors and one intern were
 able to lead twelve local church
 leaders through a three day seminar. 
 Most of these local leaders had not received
 formalized training of any kind. Our team led them through a course called 
 &#147;Bible Study Methods&#148; where we taught them the tools needed 
 to study scripture and then prepare sermons on what they learned. <br><br>
 
The unity and willingness of our Stonebriar team was 
evidence of the work of God in their lives, and He empowered them
 to show His love to each person they encountered in Guatemala.

</span>
<br>
<p>On Saturday, July 18, one of SCC&#146;s Adult Fellowships (AF), 24 hours &#146;til Monday, 
had a party to celebrate and connect with Caleb and Nicolette Hutcherson, two of our missionaries in Beirut, Lebanon. 
The class &#147;Skyped&#148; with the Hutcherson&#146;s to hear a first&#151;hand 
<IMG SRC="http://www.stonebriar.org/fileadmin/pageassets_3.0/HelpingOthers/Missions/Missions_Newsletter/AF_Missions_250.jpg" 
ALT="Adult Fellowship Missions" hspace="10" vspace="10" 
align="Left">update of their first year in Beirut. Skyping can be thought of as a video conference tool, 
so the AF and the Hutcherson&#146;s were able to see each other as they interacted. 
They were able to hear about recent ministry opportunities, the process of learning Arabic,
 and upcoming plans.<br><br>
</a> The group also had the opportunity to pray for Caleb and Nicolette and their ministry. 
 To make the connection even stronger, the Fellowship decided to try their 
 hand at several traditional Lebanese foods. It was a social gathering, 
 but one that had eternal purpose and impact.

<span style="font-size:20px;font-weight:bold;color:#CC6600;font-family:arial;line-height:110%;">Perspectives Offered at SCC This Fall</span><br>
Have you ever wanted to know more about what the Bible teaches about missions? There will be a 14 week class offered this fall called Perspectives 
on the World Christian Movement. The class will be on Tuesday evenings, from
 6:30 to 9:30 p.m., September 1 through December 8. 
 <br><br>
 The class will be foundational and meaningful in your understanding
 of our great God, and will motivate you to be involved in reaching
 those who have not yet heard of the gospel of Christ. While the class 
 is a significant commitment, you will thoroughly enjoy the worship, 
 community, and varied teaching that will be present in every single class.
 There will be a different instructor each week which includes seminary professors,
 pastors, and professionals from the missions community, some of whom will be
 travelling from as far as California to teach our class. 
 The class will be worth every penny and hour you devote to it. 
 <br><br>
 If you have any questions, please email 
 <a href="mailto:missions@stonebriar.org?subject=Missions"> 
 the Missions Department</a> or to register, go to the <a href="http://www.perspectives.org">
 Perspectives website here.</a> 
 <br><br>
 Here is what others are saying about <i>Perspectives</i><br><br>
<b>Rev. John Piper, Senior Pastor, Bethlehem Baptist Church, Minneapolis MN, Author</b>
&#147;Perspectives has been essential in mobilizing hundreds of lay people in our church
 to be World Christians and instilling passion for God's supremacy.&#148;
 <br>
<b><br>Loren Cunningham, Co-Founder, Youth With A Mission</b><br>
&#147;The whole world will be reached with the gospel when the whole church gets involved.
Perspectives is one of the keys that God is using everywhere in the Great Commission.&#148;
<br><br></b>
<b>
Avery Willis, Former Senior VP, IMB of the Southern Baptist Convention</b>
&#147;Perspectives provides believers with the finest overview of God's world-wide 
work available. I whole-heartedly recommend it for any committed disciple of Jesus.&#148;   
<br><br>
<b>Billy Graham, evangelist</b><br>
&#147;The on-going work of evangelizing the world, 
especially the unreached people groups where there is presently no church or witness, is a primary responsibility of Christians everywhere.  There is no course of which I know that will inform, inspire, and motivate Christians for world evangelization like Perspectives. It will stretch your mind, warm your heart, and stir your will.&#148;
